//! Runs stable Cargo against this repository's `.cargo/config.toml`.
//!
//! `build_backend_contract.rs` reads the configuration and the release
//! workflow as text. This test asks the tool the release actually uses: stable
//! Cargo resolves every configured profile before it looks for the target it
//! was asked to build, and stops with "config profile `dev` is not valid" when
//! one selects a codegen backend. Asking it to build a binary that does not
//! exist therefore reaches that check and then fails on the missing target,
//! without compiling anything, so a refused configuration and an accepted one
//! differ in the message. That is the failure that broke catnap's v0.1.0
//! release.
