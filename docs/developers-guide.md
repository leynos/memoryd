# Developer Guide

This guide explains the contributor workflow for the generated
Memoryd project.

## Local Workflow

Use `make all` as the public entrypoint for formatting, linting, and tests.
`make lint` runs rustdoc, Clippy, and Whitaker. `make test` prefers
`cargo nextest run` and falls back to `cargo test` when cargo-nextest is not
available. `make coverage` uses `cargo llvm-cov` with `lld`.

## Tooling

Development builds use Cranelift for debug code generation. On Linux targets,
`.cargo/config.toml` configures clang to link with `mold` so debug builds link
quickly. Coverage generation uses `lld` because LLVM coverage tooling expects
LLVM-compatible linker behaviour.

Install `clang`, `lld`, and `mold` before running the full generated workflow
locally on Linux.
