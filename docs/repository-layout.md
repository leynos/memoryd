# Repository layout

This document describes the Memoryd repository layout. It is the canonical
reference for where source code, tests, configuration, automation, and
long-lived documentation belong.

## Top-level tree

The tree below shows the repository structure. It is intentionally compact and
omits build output such as `target/`.

## Path responsibilities

- `.cargo/config.toml`: Configures Cargo defaults for local development,
  including the Linux linker.
- `tools/dev-fast/config.toml`: Opt-in Cranelift-plus-mold configuration
  fragment for accelerated local debug builds, applied explicitly by
  `make dev-build` and `make dev-test`.
- `.github/dependabot.yml`: Configures automated dependency update checks.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: Runs Memoryd's continuous integration checks.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`: Builds and publishes binary release
  artefacts for the application flavour.
- `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc`: Configures Markdown linting for documentation
  validation.
- `.rustfmt.toml`: Configures Rust formatting policy for the workspace.
- `docs/`: Holds long-lived reference documentation, guides, style rules, and
  design material.
- `docs/contents.md`: Indexes the documentation set and should be updated when
  documentation files are added, renamed, or removed.
- `docs/execplans/`: Holds execution plans for non-trivial implementation or
  remediation work.
- `docs/rfcs/`: Holds Requests for Comments (RFCs) for proposed technical
  changes.
- `docs/users-guide.md`: Explains how to use Memoryd and its public build and
  test commands.
- `docs/developers-guide.md`: Explains the contributor workflow and local
  tooling used to work on Memoryd.
- `docs/repository-layout.md`: Documents the repository tree and path
  responsibilities.
- `src/main.rs`: Contains the application entrypoint and top-level executable
  wiring.
- `tests/`: Holds integration and behavioural tests that exercise public
  behaviour.
- `tests/stub.rs`: Keeps the generated test directory valid until real tests
  replace it.
- `AGENTS.md`: Provides repository-specific working instructions for agents and
  contributors.
- `Cargo.lock`: Pins the resolved dependency graph for reproducible application
  builds.
- `Cargo.toml`: Defines package metadata, dependencies, lint policy, and Cargo
  configuration.
- `LICENSE`: Records the project licence text.
- `Makefile`: Provides the public build, lint, test, coverage, and
  documentation validation commands.
- `README.md`: Introduces the project and gives the shortest useful
  getting-started path.
- `clippy.toml`: Configures Clippy lint behaviour that is not expressed
  directly in `Cargo.toml`.
- `codecov.yml`: Configures coverage reporting behaviour.
- `rust-toolchain.toml`: Pins the Rust toolchain channel and required
  components.

## Ownership boundaries

- Keep source code under `src/`. Add modules below `src/` when a feature grows
  beyond a small entrypoint or crate root.
- Keep black-box integration tests and externally observable workflow tests
  under `tests/`.
- Keep reusable documentation under `docs/`. Update `docs/contents.md` whenever
  a documentation file is added, renamed, or removed.
- Keep build and validation entrypoints in `Makefile`; prefer adding or
  extending a Make target over documenting an ad hoc command.
- Keep continuous integration workflow changes under `.github/workflows/` and
  dependency-update policy under `.github/dependabot.yml`.
- Do not commit generated build output such as `target/`, coverage artefacts,
  or local editor state.

## Updating this document

Update this document when the repository gains a new top-level directory, a new
long-lived documentation category, a new workflow file, or a changed ownership
boundary that would otherwise make the tree misleading.
